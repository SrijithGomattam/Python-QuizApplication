# Quiz Me!

## Introduction
Welcome to the Quiz Application! This Python project allows you to take quizzes stored in XML files, answer multiple-choice or true or false questions, time how long it takes to complete the quiz, and even review and redo wrong questions. You can also view your results at the end of the quiz.

## Background
The Quiz Application was developed to address the time management challenges faced by college students. Juggling classes, extracurriculars, and personal responsibilities during exam season can be overwhelming, and finding convenient study opportunities on the go can be difficult without a reliable internet connection. By creating this application, I can now study on my laptop anywhere, without relying on the internet. The Quiz Application converts XML quiz data into interactive quizzes accessible through the terminal, providing multiple-choice and true or false questions, time tracking, and the option to review and retry incorrectly answered questions. With personalized quizzes organized in XML format, I can efficiently revise topics, practice for exams, and assess my progress. This self-contained study tool saves time, boosts my confidence, and enables me to strive for academic excellence and achieve good grades with ease.

## Features
The Quiz Application includes the following features:
- Parsing quiz data from XML files.
- Presenting questions and options to the user.
- Allowing the user to select multiple-choice or true/false answers.
- Timing the duration of the quiz.
- Allowing the user to review and retry incorrectly answered questions.
- Displaying the quiz results with a summary of the user's performance.
